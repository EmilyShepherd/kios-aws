    # Tiny Power Button is a small ACPI driver which automatically sends
    # signals to init when a hw pwr button is pressed. This is simulated
    # in AWS when it wants the instance to shutdown. This is technically
    # optional, however not handling power button presses will cause
    # instances to stay in the "Shutting Down" / "Terminating" state for
    # a while when AWS tries to remove a node, during which time the
    # node will continue operating as per. After a while, AWS' grace
    # period will expire, and the node will be ungracefully killed.
    #
    # NB: If you want to load the more fully fleged ACPI Button module,
    # this has to be unloaded first (in which case, it is recommended
    # that you appropriately signal kiOS to shutdown on power button
    # press detection via acpid / whatever else you are running).

    # the AWS distribution. If you do not want this, you cna always
    # unload this module to remove system support for shebangs.
